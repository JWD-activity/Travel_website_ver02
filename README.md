## Description
#### Project Purpose
- A single travel blog-type web page was created to practice React's **components, CSS module stylesheets, props, conditional rendering, hooks, and event handling**.

#### The challenging part
- Implementing a menu that automatically highlights when the user scrolls through each section were challenging. but I implemented this by referring to https://codedaily.io/tutorials/Sticky-Header-with-Highlighting-Sections-on-Scroll, https://codesandbox.io/s/github/codedailyio/StickyHeaderSections through a web search.


## How to use Travel website
- Users can use the website by clicking on a menu in the menu bar or scrolling to any page.
